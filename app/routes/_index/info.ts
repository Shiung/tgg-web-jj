          Betting in online casinos is primarily for entertainment purposes. However, a small percentage of people lose control when gambling. Before you start playing games, it's important to understand that gaming should not be viewed as a source of income or a means to pay off debt. It is beneficial to keep track of the time and money spent at online casinos on a daily basis. OK fun only accepts players over the age of 18 and uses all applicable methods to prevent minors from registering and playing at our casino. The casino reserves the right to require players to provide proof of identity and will deny access to the site if the player is under the legal gambling age. However, we recognize that due to the widespread availability of the Internet, persons under the age of 18 may still register and play at online casinos. Therefore, we strongly encourage parents to work together to protect their children from visiting gambling sites. There is specialized software that can help with this situation. For more information, please visit the websites listed below.
